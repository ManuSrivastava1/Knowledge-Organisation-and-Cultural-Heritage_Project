|Third Architectural Maquette for “The Gates of Hell”|This model, an extraordinary visual record of Rodin's thought processes and working method, is the third that the artis made after receiving the prized commission for a set of monumental bronze doors. It reveals that by this early date he had already abandoned a strict narrative rendering of Dante's Inferno and discarded the notion of the doors as functional architectural features that would open or close. It was presented to Kojiro Matsukata, Kobe, by Musée Rodin, Paris, prior to 1926; sequestered by French government, 1944; vested in French government under San Francisco Peace Treaty, 1952; transferred from French to Japanese government, 23 January 1959; entered into NMWA, April 1959.|
|Portrait ofAuguste Rodin by Claudel|There are few known portraits of Rodin. Alongside the work sculpted by Jules Desbois, this bust is indisputably the portrait of the master that has had the greatest impact. Sculpted by Camille Claudel in a naturalistic way around the time between 1886 and 1888. Every little muscle is detailed in the sculptor’s deeply lined face, with its strong nose and forehead. Camille Claudel took Rodin for her model several times, depicting him in drawings and in a painted portrait that is now lost. According to author Edmond Pilon, writing in 1900 for the art journal Iris, Claudel’s work captured “the calm, profound face of genius.” From then on, the bust became a sort of symbol―an official portrait of the artist, featured in major Rodin exhibitions worldwide, from Chicago to Amsterdam, from Prague to New York.|

|Photo of Gates of paradise|Combining a goldsmith's delicacy with a foundryman's bravura, sculptor Lorenzo Ghiberti condensed the Old Testament into ten panels to produce one of the defining masterpieces of the Italian Renaissance. Michelangelo likened the gilded bronze doors of Florence's Baptistery of San Giovanni to the "Gates of Paradise" from where they get their name. These were one of the first and major inspirations for the concept behind Rodin's Gates of Hell. Les Fleurs du mal|We know that Baudelaire's poetry inspired him early and deeply:** his influence is evident as early as 1880 with the creation of the Gate of Hell and also in the drawings of the Sapphic couples starting from the second half of 1890. Several figures or groups of figures present on the doors of the door, which have in some cases become autonomous works, actually, take up the titles of the poems of the Fleurs du Mal like the 'Dammned Women/Femmes damnées', or are accompanied by verses extrapolated by such poems: as well as the theme of Fugit Amor, which appears twice in the right doorway.|
|Rodin: The Gates of Hell(1982 Documentary) |This award-winning film chronicles Rodin's struggles and sacrifices in creating a monumental work of art -- and the extraordinary modern-day effort to give it the final form he envisioned when a century after Rodin's death, legendary New York businessman and philanthropist B. Gerald Cantor and his wife, Iris, convened a team of experts to attempt the first-ever bronze casting of The Gates of Hell using the painstaking "lost wax" method that Rodin himself had favored. The finished piece would stand 21 feet high and 12 feet wide, and weigh eight tons.|
|Damned women| Rodin combined two female figures that appear separately in The Gates of Hell to create one of his most boldly erotic works. In this sculpture of impassioned lovers, their straining bodies and projecting limbs manifest the experience of physical pleasure. The pejorative title comes from a poem of the same name in Charles Baudelaire’s Flowers of Evil that portrays lesbians as “damned women,” condemned to Hell for their “unnatural” desires.Rodin has also used this sculpture in his Gates oh hell top right part|
