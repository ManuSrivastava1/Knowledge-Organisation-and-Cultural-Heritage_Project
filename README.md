## Topic:Rodin's Gates of Hell — A Linked Open Data(LOD) Project
### Why The gates of Hell(French: La Porte de l'Enfer)

The Gates of Hell occupied a unique place in Rodin’s oeuvre. Working feverishly on this project for several years, he created over 200 figures and groups that formed a breeding ground for ideas which he drew on for the rest of his working life. Having hoped to exhibit his Gates at the 1889 Exposition Universelle, but probably too busy to finish them, the sculptor stopped working on them circa 1890.

He did, however, express his desire to complete them on several occasions. In 1900, he decided to finally unveil them at his first solo exhibition in Paris. But they were shown in a fragmentary state, since he had given up the idea of mounting the figures that stood out the most – the individual figures cast separately from the main structure – because he thought they produced too strong an effect of contrast with the background.

In 1907, The Gates almost saw the day in a luxury bronze and marble version to be erected in the Musée du Luxembourg, which housed works purchased by the French state from contemporary artists.

Not until 1917 did Léonce Bénédite, the Musée Rodin’s first curator, manage to persuade the sculptor to allow him to reconstruct his masterpiece in order to have it cast in bronze. Rodin died before seeing the result of all these long years of effort.

We have chosen to describe this sculpture kept him engaged for 37 years, making it one of those rare works in the history of art which encompass, in a literal sense, the creative lifespan of it maker. It can be seen as a source of multiple other works done by him and some have called it his `Magnum Opus` even though it was never finished during his lifetime. For these reasons, it is well suited to show the sculptor's creative process.

We can use xceel-sheet to provide a description of out items according to our Conceptual Model.

There could be letters where he talks about the gates of hell or others writing to him about it, but I need help in finding them.
